This repository contains examples of a simple application using the different state managers listed below.

## Install and run

```sh
# install
yarn
```

## Hooks

Native approach of a state management using the following hooks:
- `useReducer`
- `useContext`

```sh
yarn run start:reducer-context
```

## Redux / Redux toolkit

The goal was to explain how to move from a redux application towards a redux-toolkit one. You can check and play with both of them using the following command

```sh
# Redux 
yarn run start:sandbox

# Redux Toolkit
yarn run start:redux
```

## Recoil

The same application was developed using Recoil - both hooks and async functions. 

```
yarn run start:recoil
```

## XState

TBD
